# InventoryApp
This is a simple Inventory App made for learning purposes which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory.  The app does not use any external libraries and is written in raw java.  This project is about combining various ideas and skills used in android developing. They include:  Storing information in a SQLite database  Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database  Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data  Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users  Updating information based on user input  Creating intents to other apps using stored information  Usage of Loaders to which run on separate threads to prevent janky or unresponsive UI (Feature deprecated see: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/loaders for more details).
